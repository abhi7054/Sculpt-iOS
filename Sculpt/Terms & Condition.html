        <strong>Welcome to the Terms & Conditions</strong>
        
        <p>1. In order to become a Customer (“Customer” or “you“) of the Platform and to enjoy the service provided and features available on the Platform (“SCULPT Services“), you must read and accept all these Terms. By using or subscribing for any part of the Platform, you indicated that you accept these Terms and that you agree to abide by them. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Platform. You may be asked to agree to additional terms and conditions if you register or sign up for any additional, alternative or enhanced services or products. These additional terms may be with SCULPT or with an applicable third party, but on all occasions will be provided to you in advance of you deciding to register or sign up for the new product or service.</p>

    <p>1. You must be 18 years of age or over to use the Platform and/or the SCULPT Services and to make any purchases.</p>

    <p>5. The Platform may not be used in connection with any commercial endeavours except those that are specifically endorsed or approved by SCULPT. Illegal and/or unauthorised use of the SCULPT Services is prohibited. Unauthorised commercial advertisements, affiliate links and other forms of solicitation may be removed from Customer accounts without notice and may result in termination of Customer privileges. Appropriate legal action will be taken for any illegal or unauthorised use of the SCULPT Services. You are prohibited from selling, trading or otherwise transferring your SCULPT account to another party.</p>

If you choose to create an account with us, you agree to provide only accurate, complete registration information, and you will keep that information up-to-date if it changes. When you register to become a Customer, you need to submit your name and a valid email address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account, log-in details and password and should not share these with any other party. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify SCULPT immediately if you suspect any unauthorised use of your account or any other breach of security. SCULPT cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section.

We may require users to re-validate their accounts if we suspect use of an invalid email address.</p>
