        <p>We are SCULPT,</p>
        <p>by registering to use our Services, you consent to us processing your personal information in accordance with this Privacy and Cookie Policy (the “Policy”). This is the legal basis upon which we process your personal information as well as because it is necessary for the performance of our obligations under the terms of use. You may withdraw such consent at any time by letting us know at contact@hypertapp.com</p>

        <p>At that time, you may also want to remove any cookies which have been placed on any device used to access the Website. Your withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out by us prior to such withdrawal.</p>

        <p>We want you to obtain personalised experiences anytime, anywhere, on any device. This requires us to collect personal information from you. However, we want to put you in control of that personal information. We want you to be aware at all times where and how your personal information is being used. This is of paramount importance to us.</p>
        <p>So, let’s describe what this Policy tells you. It explains:</p>

        <p>* what information we may collect about you;</p>
        <p>* what we may do with the information we collect about you;</p>
        <p>* whether we share your information with anyone else;</p>
        <p>* the types of cookies we use and how you can reject these cookies;</p>
        <p>* where we store your information;</p>
        <p>* how we keep your information secure; and</p>
        <p>* your rights in relation to your information.</p>
         
        <p>At SCULPT we take your privacy seriously. We operate on the principle that your personal information belongs to you and only you can decide who you want to share it with and why. This is fundamental to the way we work and we’re committed to providing a secure environment for you to store your personal information and share it with others when you want to.</p>
