        <strong>Welcome to the Terms & Conditions</strong> <p>
        <pre  style="word-wrap: break-word;">
        1. In order to become a Customer (“Customer” or “you“) of the Platform and to enjoy the service provided and features available on the Platform (“SCULPT Services“), you must read and accept all these Terms. By using or subscribing for any part of the Platform, you indicated that you accept these Terms and that you agree to abide by them. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the Platform. You may be asked to agree to additional terms and conditions if you register or sign up for any additional, alternative or enhanced services or products. These additional terms may be with SCULPT or with an applicable third party, but on all occasions will be provided to you in advance of you deciding to register or sign up for the new product or service.

        2. Use of SCULPT Services

        1. You must be 18 years of age or over to use the Platform and/or the SCULPT Services and to make any purchases.
        3. Use of the Platform or SCULPT Services requires a connection to the Internet and appropriate telecommunication infrastructure. We are not liable for any costs you may incur from use of such.
        5. The Platform may not be used in connection with any commercial endeavours except those that are specifically endorsed or approved by SCULPT. Illegal and/or unauthorised use of the SCULPT Services is prohibited. Unauthorised commercial advertisements, affiliate links and other forms of solicitation may be removed from Customer accounts without notice and may result in termination of Customer privileges. Appropriate legal action will be taken for any illegal or unauthorised use of the SCULPT Services. You are prohibited from selling, trading or otherwise transferring your SCULPT account to another party.
        7. You will need to register to use the Platform by creating an account with SCULPT. This is so that we can provide you with easy access to your personal section of the Platform. You can register directly with us in order to use the Platform and the SCULPT Services. If you choose to create an account with us, you agree to provide only accurate, complete registration information, and you will keep that information up-to-date if it changes. When you register to become a Customer, you need to submit your name and a valid email address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account, log-in details and password and should not share these with any other party. You are fully responsible for all activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify SCULPT immediately if you suspect any unauthorised use of your account or any other breach of security. SCULPT cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this section. Any accounts which have been registered with another person’s email address or with temporary email addresses may be closed without notice. We may require users to re-validate their accounts if we suspect use of an invalid email address.
        9. Third party merchants (the “Merchants“) may advertise goods and services on the Platform from time to time. It is at the Merchant’s sole discretion to determine whether advertised packages can be used in conjunction with any other promotions, vouchers, third party certificates or coupons. SCULPT is not responsible for any goods or services supplied to you by a third party, including those which were advertised to you on the Platform. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that you are satisfied with terms on which you are engaging with the applicable third party.

        3. Availability and Access to the Platform and SCULPT Services

        When you subscribe for a free section of the Platform or SCULPT Service (the “Free Version”):

        1. The Free Version is made available to you free of charge and on as “as is” basis. In particular: its functionality may not be as described in the product description; it may not be of satisfactory quality; it may contain defects; it may not be fit for any particular purpose; it may not meet your requirements; it may not be compatible with your hardware or software; and it may not be secure.

        2. If you have subscribed for the Free Version:

        * we do not undertake to correct any defects in the Platform or SCULPT Services; and
        * subject to the Consumer Rights Act 2015, we may remove any functionality from the Platform without providing any reason or warning.

        2. You can upgrade from the Free Version to the Paid-for Version to access additional features and services at any time.

        When you subscribe for a paid-for section of the Platform or SCULPT Service (the “Paid-for Version”):

        We will use reasonable endeavours to notify you in advance of scheduled maintenance but you acknowledge that you may receive no advance notification for downtime caused by emergency maintenance or events outside of our reasonable control.

        We cannot guarantee that the Platform will always be available. Sometimes there are errors which affect the availability of the SCULPT Services or the Platform or which require us to undertake some maintenance work.

        The price of a Paid-for Version subscription will be the price stated either on our website or on the relevant app store from time to time and will be communicated to you when you sign up for the Paid-for Version. All prices listed on our website are exclusive of VAT and other applicable sales taxes.

        Unless you purchase the Paid-for Version via a third party app store, in which case you should refer to the relevant app store’s payment terms, we will take payment using the bank details or card details you provide to us when you sign up for the Paid-for Version.
